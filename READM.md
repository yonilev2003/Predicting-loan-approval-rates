# Predicting Loan Approval Rates with Machine Learning

Hello, I'm Yonathan 👋, a self-taught data scientist hailing from the vibrant heart of Israel. My journey into the world of data began out of pure passion and curiosity, which has since evolved into a full-fledged mission to harness the power of machine learning to make sense of numbers and predict trends that can impact lives.

## About The Project

In my latest venture, I delve into the complex world of finance to tackle one of the most pressing questions for many: "Will my loan get approved?" Using a dataset of 4,269 loan applicants, I embark on creating four machine learning models to predict loan approval rates with an accuracy that was once thought to be the stuff of fiction.

### Key Features

- **In-depth Analysis:** Dive deep into the dataset with comprehensive exploratory data analysis, featuring data visualization and statistical testing to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
- **Statistical Significance:** Employ statistical tests to challenge and validate hypotheses, providing a robust foundation for model predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Explore ensemble methods with four sophisticated machine learning models, meticulously tuned to avoid overfitting and maximize predictive power.
- **Practical Insights:** Beyond the numbers, gain actionable insights on the factors influencing loan approvals, potentially guiding your next loan application towards a favorable outcome.

### Built With

This project is brought to life using Python and a host of libraries designed for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, including:

- Pandas & NumPy for data wrangling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building and tuning machine learning models

## Getting Started

To explore this project and run the models yourself, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment (recommendation: use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easy management)
- Installation of the required libraries:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
