## About The Project

In my project, I delve into the world of finance to tackle one of the most pressing questions for many: "Will my loan get approved?" Using a dataset of 4,269 loan applicants and after a thorough EDA, I created four machine learning models to predict loan approval chances with an outstanding accuracy.

### Key Features

- **In-depth Analysis:** Dive deep into the dataset with comprehensive exploratory data analysis, featuring data visualization and statistical testing to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
- **Statistical Significance:** Using statistical tests to challenge and validate hypotheses, providing a robust foundation for model predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Explore ensemble methods with four sophisticated machine learning models, meticulously tuned to avoid overfitting and maximize predictive power.
- **Practical Insights:** Beyond the numbers, gain actionable insights on the factors influencing loan approvals, potentially guiding your next loan application towards a favorable outcome.

### Built With

This project is brought to life using Python and a host of libraries designed for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, including:

- Pandas & NumPy for data wrangling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building and tuning machine learning models

## Getting Started

To explore this project and run the models yourself, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment (recommendation: use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easy management)
- Installation of the required libraries:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yonilev2003/Predicting-loan-approval-rates.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

For those looking to apply these models to predict loan approval rates, the project provides a detailed notebook that guides you through the data analysis, model building, and evaluation processes. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, a finance professional, or simply someone curious about machine learning's potential in financial decision-making, this project has something for you.
